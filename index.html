        <p>In a nutshell, we are another free mail service like Gmail. </p>
        <p>But our system doesn't work exactly like other mail services. In fact, our product tagline is "The Zero Spam Mail Service". That's because if you use our system properly, you are not going to receive any spam at all.</p>
        <p>Our system is a two sided system. (1) Dombox (2) Teleport</p>
        <p>Dombox stands for "Domain-based Isolated Mailbox" and Teleport is our "Contract-based Authentication Service"</p>
        <p>Dombox + Teleport = No Spam </p>
        <p>So the following products are our major competitors.</p>
        <table class="table table-bordered">
            <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Mail</td>
                <td>Gmail, Outlook and YahooMail</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Auth Buttons</td>
                <td>Facebook Connect and Google Connect</td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>Our email addresses will be ending with @domboxmail.com just like Gmail addresses ending with @gmail.com</p>

        <h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>

        <p>In simple words, we are trying to make your email address useless in the spammer hands instead of relying on spam filters.</p>
        <p>That means, a spammer may get your email address, but still can't able to mail you.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 id="solution-summary">Solution Summary</h2>

        <p><u>Heads Up!</u> Our system is not a "replacement" to the existing email system, but an "upgrade". Meaning, our system is backward compatible and you can use our system just like you use in other mail services like Gmail. As a matter of fact, you can even use your @gmail.com address in our system.</p>

        <p>We have two kind of mailboxes. (A) Normal Mailboxes (B) Isolated Mailboxes</p>
        <p>We solve the email spam problem in three phases.</p>
        <p>Phase 1: Isolation, Phase 2: Restriction, Phase 3: Injection</p>

        <h3>Phase 1: Isolation</h3>
        <div class="mustache"></div>
        <p>This phase deals with Isolated Mailboxes.</p>
        <p>In this phase all the websites you signup are isolated. An isolated mailbox will be given to each website you signup.  Only that particular website can send mails to that isolated mailbox by default. </p>
        <p>However that particular website can whitelist certain third party domains in their DNS to send mail to their isolated mailbox. These whitelisted domains are called "Sender Alias Domains" in our system</p>
        <p>e.g. An "Isolated Mailbox" is created for amazon.co.uk. By default amazon.co.uk can mail to that box. To accept mail from jeff@amazon.com, amazon.co.uk should whitelist amazon.com in their DNS   </p>
        <p>All websites have exclusive unrestricted privilege to send mails to their "Isolated Mailbox".</p>
        <p>A user can have unlimited "Isolated Mailboxes"</p>
        <p>Note: An "Isolated Mailbox" is a property of both website owner and the mail user. Only website owner has write privileges and Only the mail user has read and delete privileges</p>
        <h3>Phase 2: Restriction</h3>
        <div class="mustache"></div>
        <p>This phase deals with Normal Mailboxes.</p>
        <p>A normal mailbox works exactly the same way just like your @gmail.com mailbox. However our normal mailboxes comes with an option called "Restricted Mode".  </p>
        <p>When enabled, it allows mails only from the contacts found in your "Contacts" list.</p>
        <p>Since we already isolated website related mails with "Isolated Mailboxes",  normal mailboxes contains only the real conversational mails you get from your friends, family or someone you already know. So when you enable "Restricted Mode", it's more like hanging a board with sign "Authorized Personnel Only"</p>
        <p>Keep in mind, you cannot have "Restriction" without "Isolation". Because we offload all website related mails to "Isolated Mailboxes" and then keep only the conversational mails in "Normal Mailboxes"</p>
        <h3>Phase 3: Injection</h3>
        <div class="mustache"></div>
        <p>Via “Isolation” you allow only certain “Websites” to mail you and via “Restriction” you allow only certain “Individuals” to mail you.</p>
        <p>So both "Isolation" and "Restriction" phase makes our system bullet proof from spammers. But it also makes the system bullet proof from Genuine senders who are not on your contact list. Let’s call them "Genuine Strangers".</p>
        <p>This phase makes sure only the "Genuine Strangers" can able to mail you without any issues. But not the spammers. This phase contains two options. (1) Phone number validation (2) Attention Fee</p>
        <p>In "Phone number validation", the sender need to enter your phone number correctly to allow mails.</p>
        <p>In "Attention Fee", an amount will be charged from the sender. If you mark the received mail as genuine, then the contact will be added to your "Contacts" and the amount will be refunded to the sender. The amount can be set from 1 cent to $1000. Default value: 1 cent.</p>
        <p>Note: All these three phases are optional. You signup to our mail service just like you do in other mail services. If you want "Isolation", just activate our "Domboxes" extension. That would enable rest of the phases too.</p>
        <p>Note for email experts: No... we don't send an email back, asking for payment. To prevent backscatter attacks we generate a random link during the SMTP conversation itself. </p>
        <p>e.g. “550 Unauthorized sender. Use this link to inject the message. https://dbx.ly/abcdefg”</p>
