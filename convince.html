        <p>Hello random Netizen,</p>
        <p>Nice to meet you. My name is Viruthagiri Thirumavalavan. I'm the guy behind Dombox, Inc.</p>
        <p>This page contains the script I wrote for my video to convince the audience to be part of my cause. Unfortunately, I was unable to make that video.</p>
        <p>I put the script here as it is with some minor modifications. I hope this script would convince you to be part of my cause.</p>
        <p>If you directly visited this page, make sure to read our <a href="https://www.dombox.org/">home page</a> first, before reading this page.</p>
        <p>Shall we begin?</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Do you have any knowledge about the second world war?</p>
        <p>Second world war killed plenty of innocent people. According to some statistics the casualties were around 80 million.</p>
        <p>Hitler played an important role in second world war. You obviously know that.</p>
        <p>Now I have a question for you. If you can go back in time and If you had the chance to save those 80 million people, would you save them?  </p>
        <p>Hitler is standing in front of you. Alone.. No one is there. All you have to do is pull the trigger and come back to the present day. </p>
        <p>Don’t worry. Hitler is not popular yet. So if you kill him he becomes a nobody. So you don’t have to worry about your life in the present world.</p>
        <p>Now the question is, Would you pull the trigger? </p>
        <p>If your answer is Yes, then you are no better than Hitler. </p>
        <p>Sure.. you saved those 80 million people? But at what cost? Hitler was one of the driving force of 20th century innovations. </p>
        <p>Fine.. He didn't directly invent things. But he played an indirect role in plenty of innovations. </p>
        <p>Medicines, Weapons, Transports, Communications and many other fields had seen accelerated growth during the Second World War. </p>
        <p>It was a innovate or die situation. If you don’t innovate then you are falling behind your enemy. For example, faster transports needed to deliver payloads like weapons quickly. So countries invested money on such researches.</p>
        <p>So by killing Hitler, you just made a setback to our technological advancement. While you are at it, you also killed at least a billion people. You might have killed them softly. But you killed them nonetheless.</p>
        <p>Allow me to explain how.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 id="predestination-paradox">Predestination Paradox</h2>
        <p>If you ever watched time travel movies, then you already know that the plot of many time travel movies are "Time Loop".  </p>
        <p>That is whatever happening now, already happened.  </p>
        <p>For example, You are watching this video right now. Let’s say 5 years from now, someone invents time travel. That person uses the machine and travels back to 10 years. Now you are stuck in a loop. You maybe watching my video for the millionth time. </p>
        <p>The time traveller maybe thinking that he is going to change the past by going back. But he changes nothing. This is known as predestination paradox. i.e. Everything is predestined. Even the invention of time machine.  </p>
        <p>Just think of it like a snake eating its own tail. Many time travel movies follows that principle. </p>
        <p>But wait…there is a flaw in that principle.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="section">
        <h2 id="the-sperm-theory">The Sperm Theory</h2>
        <p>John is a Canadian who is living in Canada. Chan is a Chinese who is living in China. They both were born in January 1st 1990, exactly the same time.  Now ironically, 9 months earlier, both John’s parents and Chan’s parents played the "Mummy-Daddy Game" exactly the same time.</p>
        <p>Now let’s say someone uses a time machine and goes back exactly one hour before their parents play the "Mummy-Daddy Game".</p>
        <p>If the time traveller goes back to somewhere near John’s parents house in Canada, then there is higher chance John may not be present in the contemporary world. But Chan will be present. He may be living a different life. But definitely he will be here.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 id="the-olive-oil-experiment">The Olive Oil Experiment</h2>
        <p>I have a bucket of drinking water here. I’m going to put a single drop of olive oil in the centre of this water slowly. Now let’s give some time.</p>
        <p>As you can see, it spreads and contaminates the water slowly. It would take some time to spread. But once it's done, the whole water is undrinkable now.</p>
        <p>In John’s life, the time traveller triggered such chain of events. Because of such events, John’s parents may or may not play the "Mommy-Daddy Game" on that day. If they play the game, the probability of John being the real John is 1 in billion. That’s because, just like you and me, John is the champion of the sperm race. So this time one of his siblings would win the race. </p>
        <p>To summarise,</p>
        <p>(A) John may never born. It’s a possibility.</p>
        <p>(B) If John was born, the probability of John being the real John is 1 in a Billion. i.e. John might have born as one of his male sibling John, or as one of his female sibling Jane or even as one of his Transgender sibling Joanne.</p>
        <p>So what exactly happened?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 id="atoms">Atoms</h2>
        <p>Everything you see, eat, touch and breathe, I mean everything<sup style="color: red">*</sup> as in "Everyyyyy thing" is made of atoms.  </p>
        <p>This wooden table is made of atoms. This glass of water is made of atoms. The air we breathe is made of atoms. You and me, we both are made of atoms. it's not only earth, the entire cosmic universe is made of atoms. The outer space is made of gas. But if we dissect those gases they are still made of atoms. </p>
        <p>In simple words. "Even the empty space in space is not empty"</p>
        <p>If you had completed at least high school, then most likely, you have learned the formula for water molecule. </p>
        <p>H<sub>2</sub>O Right?</p>
        <p>What does that mean? It means "Two" Hydrogen atoms and "One" Oxygen atom makes up that molecule. Hydrogen has atomic weight of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Periodic_table_(standard_atomic_weight)">1.008</a>  and the Oxygen has atomic weight of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Periodic_table_(standard_atomic_weight)">15.999</a>.</p>
        <p>Take an orange and take two small grapes. Glue those two grapes in the orange. That's how a water molecule look like. At least trillion of those water molecules makes up this glass of water.</p>
        <p>The air you breathe is made of Nitrogen and Oxygen atoms. You probably already know about the Oxygen part since we need that to survive. Note: Single "O" represents the oxygen atom, "O<sub>2</sub>" represents the oxygen molecule.</p>
        <p>This is a Sandstone. The size of this stone is somewhere around 1 mm. <a target="_blank" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tiny_1mm_Ferrite_Core_Magnet.jpg">Refer this image</a> to get the idea of how 1 mm object look like.  </p>
        <p>Let's analyse this sand stone in two different perspective.</p>
        <p>Perspective 1: Atoms:</p>
        <p>This sandstone is made of at least 1 million atoms.</p>
        <p>Perspective 2: Viruses:</p>
        <p>The size of a virus is somewhere around 500 nanometers.  </p>
        <p>That means if this sandstone is made of virus, it can hold around 2000 virus. And yes all viruses are made of atoms.</p>
        <p><sup style="color: red">*</sup> Few things are not made of atoms. e.g. Light</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 id="chaos-theory">Chaos Theory</h2>
        <p>Now let’s come to conclusion.</p>
        <p>To change the past, You don’t have to physically go back and kill Hitler. You don’t have to go back to John’s parents house. </p>
        <p>All you have to do is that, just transport this 1 mm sandstone back in time and you altered the entire course of the present world. </p>
        <p>This is known as "Butterfly Effect". </p>
        <p>"The flap of a butterfly's wing in Brazil can set off a cascade of atmospheric events that, weeks later, spurs the formation of a tornado in Texas."</p>
        <p>In mathematics, This is what <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory">chaos theory</a> is all about. A minor change in the system would yield chaos results.</p>
        <p>It's like trying add more cells in the centre of a <a target="_blank" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bienenwabe_Ausbau_der_Mittelwand_79a.jpg">honeycomb</a>.  If you were able to add more cells successfully, then you dislocated the old cells. Right? </p>
        <p>You should think of time travel in that perspective. You are not trying to change the past. But trying to dislocate the entire universe. </p>
        <p>The only difference with my honeycomb analogy is that, In honeycomb you dislocated the cells only to a certain distance. But in time travel you created Chaos. </p>
        <p>1 mm might sound like a very tiny amount. But like I said it can hold 2000 viruses. So the guy who is supposed to get cold and sneeze for a week, is not sick now. The speed of a sneeze is 100 miles per hour. Or should I say, you are moving the air atoms 100 miles per hour when you sneeze. So the chain reaction is altered and it creates a different version of the universe. You get the picture, right?</p>
        <p>Now this is what I’m talking about when I say there is a flaw in the predestination paradox. Nothing is predestined.</p>
        <p>If you go back in time multiple times to the same period, then that’s like adding a drop of rose essence in a glass of water multiple times. For each time you travel back in time add a drop to the glass of water. The first drop is close to the world as we know it, than the 100th drop.</p>
        <p>Now it's all Science Fiction. Right?.. But let me tell you a non-fiction story. Raise your hand, if it rings any bell.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="section">
        <h2 id="the-four-pests-campaign">The Four Pests Campaign</h2>
        <p>In the late 1950s, Chinese government introduced a campaign called as the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=The+Four+Pests+Campaign">Four Pests Campaign</a> </p>
        <p>The following four pests must be eliminated. Mosquitoes, Flies, Sparrows and Rats.</p>
        <p>Mosquitoes should be eliminated because it spreads Malaria.</p>
        <p>Rats should be eliminated because it spreads Plague.</p>
        <p>Flies should be eliminated because it spreads Other diseases.</p>
        <p>Sparrows should be eliminated because it eats the grains on the paddy fields. </p>
        <p>Among these 4 pests, people mostly targeted the sparrows because of its size.</p>
        <p>In 2 years they killed massive amount of sparrows.</p>
        <p>Here is the problem. The sparrows not only ate the grains. It also ate the insects and worms found in the paddy fields. Since there was no predator, the insects and worms were out of control.  It ruined the grains. The ecosystem failed and this created one of the worst famines in history, it's called as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Chinese_Famine">Great Chinese Famine</a>. </p>
        <p>According to estimates, this Famine killed 15 to 45 million Chinese people.</p>

        <p>Let's apply the knowledge we acquired so far.</p>
        <p>So far we were talking about the past. Now let’s talk about the future. </p>
        <p>You see, I just dropped this pen. The events happened in your life triggered me to drop this pen. If I try to erase some events from your past, then that would change the events in my life too. I may not drop this pen.</p>
        <p>The same way, If I didn’t drop this pen, then you may be doing something else instead of watching my video.</p>
        <p>My point is that, for better or worse, you are being part of my life, just like I’m being part of yours.</p>
        <p style="text-decoration: underline">You, me and all living beings on earth, we are building our tomorrows together. The actions we take today sets the course of our tomorrow.</p>
        <p>As of 2018, there are 3.8 Billion email users out there. That's half of the world population. We are trying to build a Spamless Internet that's gonna make at least billions of people lives better. Just imagine the butterfly effect it's going to have on our future.</p>
        <p>So come on my friend, We need your help. The world needs your help. Go ahead.. Be part of my cause.</p>
        <p>You can help us in any way you can. If you have a blog write about us. If you are media person, let your audience know about us. If you are a Youtuber, make a "How Dombox Works" video for your subscribers.</p>
        <p>You can even make a difference to the world, by just sharing this page in social media. You are creating a "Butterfly Effect", when you share this page in social media</p>
