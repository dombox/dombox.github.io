        <h2 id="">Unstable Users</h2>
        <p>By creating Dombox (D) we may have reduced the spam, but we created another problem. The consumers have full control to the box. The consumers can make their box offline or delete it completely anytime they want.</p>
        <p>This may please the consumers but not the businesses. From business perspective, these users are nothing but "Unstable Users". i.e. They can disappear any time.</p>
        <p>Recently Facebook’s privacy fiasco costed them billions of dollars. People started to delete their Facebook accounts. People who deleted their Facebook accounts also encouraged others to delete it using the #DeleteFacebook campaign.</p>
        <p>Last year people were pissed about the way Uber doing business and started #DeleteUber campaign. Unlike Facebook, Uber is a Private Company. So the campaign didn’t do much damage. Uber only lost around 500,000 users.</p>
        <p>Both campaign would have had massive success if most of their users were Dombox users. Because we are letting the users to delete their box with a Single click.</p>
        <p>Let’s get one thing straight. Dombox is here to solve the spam problem. Not to jeopardize other businesses.</p>
        <p>Dotcom Investors depends on metrics like “Number of Users” for valuing a company. So If we don’t solve the "Unstable Users" problem, then every business in the world gonna hate our mail service. So let's solve that.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 id="">Combox (C)</h2>
        <p>The Combox (C) box type revokes the box deletion and box offline privileges from the consumer.</p>
        <p>The term “Combox” refers to a Dombox that is under contract. In other words Combox refers to a “Contract-based Dombox”.</p>
        <p>The term “Contract” refers to an agreement between “Consumer” and the “Business”.</p>
        <p>To initiate a Contract, business owners must register an App in our website and then they have to display a button on their websites</p>
        <p>To register an App, business need to verify their domain first, since all contracts are linked to a particular domain</p>
        <p>When a contract is signed, it also creates the Combox (C) for that contract automatically.</p>
        <p>Combox (C) cannot be created from our website. User need to visit the third party website and then click our “Auth” button to initiate the ”Contract”</p>
        <p>The whole point of Combox (C) is that, the box can accept only the mails that pass all 5 layers. i.e. Score 5 mails</p>
        <p>The business agrees to that part and we revoke the box deletion and box offline privileges from the consumer</p>
        <p>Business Side: Stable Users</p>
        <p>Consumer Side: Spam free Combox (C)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 id="">Auth Buttons</h2>
        <p>You might have seen "Auth Buttons" like "Signup with Facebook", "Signup with Google" etc. on the Internet.</p>
        <p>There are at least 100+ auth buttons available on the internet.</p>
        <p>We are trying to make all these buttons obsolete by disrupting with our "Auth Button" called "Teleport"</p>
        <p>Our "Auth Button" solves one major issue => Internet Privacy</p>
        <p>Let's understand how our "Auth Button" works.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 id="">Portal</h2>
        <p>Portal can mean many things. e.g. Web portal. But we are using the term Portal in science fiction context.</p>
        <p>You might have seen the portals in movies. In the movie Avengers, they use a Vertical Portal to travel between planets. But in the movie Dr. Strange, they use Horizontal Portals to travel between places on earth.</p>
        <p>We’re using the term "Portal" because the consumers saves their time by skipping the process like filling registration forms, Creating a contract, Creating a Combox, Verifying emails etc. Consumers also skip the Login forms while logging in.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 id="">Teleport</h2>
        <p>The whole point of portal is to travel quickly between two distant points.</p>
        <p>You go through one door but come via another.</p>
        <p>The process happening between these two doors, is called "Teleportation".</p>
        <p>Definition from WikiPedia: Teleportation is the theoretical transfer of matter or energy from one point to another without traversing the physical space between them</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 id="">Portal vs Teleport</h2>
        <p>We use both terms. "Portal" and “Teleport". Keep in mind, The term "Portal" is intended for "Businesses" and The term "Teleport" is intended for "Consumers".</p>
        <p>Note for Developers: Please use the terminology exactly. e.g. Portal ID and Portal Secret. Don't call it Client ID, Consumer ID etc.</p>
        <p>Business owners creates the Portals. But its the consumers who are gonna travel through them.</p>
        <p>Take Facebook for an example, If you want to display "Signup with Facebook" button on your website, then you need to register your app first in Facebook and then you will have to display the "Signup with Facebook" button. So two things. App and Button</p>
        <p>In Dombox Terminology, those "Apps" are called "Portals". And the button is called "Teleport"</p>
        <p>If still it doesn't make sense to you, "Teleport" button is nothing but "Signup with Dombox" button</p>
    </div>

        <table class="table table-bordered">
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Flexible Contracts</td>
            <td>Flexible contracts has "no end date". We’ll explain later why its called Flexible contract.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Fixed Contracts</td>
            <td>Fixed contracts has an "end date". The end date can be either relative or absolute.</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 id="">Fixed Contracts - Relative</h2>
        <p>Relative end type contracts has the “same duration” for all contracts regardless of the signup date. </p>
        <p>The best use case for relative end type contract is a student web portal.</p>
        <p>Priya, Khan and David they are all trying to signup for a 2 years course. </p>
        <p>Priya’s course starts at Jan 2018 and ends at jan 2020. Khan’s course starts at Jan 2019 and ends at jan 2021. Davids’s course starts at Jan 2020 and ends at jan 2022</p>
        <p>As you can see they all have the same duration regardless of the signup date.  In this case they are all on contract for 2 years.</p>
        <p>In relative end type, you need to provide a relative duration. The relative duration can be in Days, Weeks, Months and Years. </p>
        <p>e.g. 30 days from the signup date, 5 weeks from the signup date, 6 months from the signup date, 2 years from the signup date. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 id="">Fixed Contracts - Absolute</h2>
        <p>Absolute end type contracts has “variable duration” for all contracts.</p>
        <p>The best use case for absolute end type contract is a music concert.</p>
        <p>Let’s just say Katy Perry has a music concert in Dec 2020 and the event organiser would like to keep in touch with the online ticket buyers till the concert date.  In this case the event organiser can go for absolute end type contract.</p>
        <p>Priya buys the concert ticket on Jan 2018. Khan buys the concert ticket on Jan 2019. David buys the concert ticket on Jan 2020</p>
        <p>But all their contracts ends on Dec 2020 once the concert is over.</p>
        <p>If you do the math, Priya is on contract for 3 years, Khan is on contract for 2 years and  David is on contract for 1 year. So the duration is not the same in absolute end type contracts. </p>
        <p>In absolute end type, you need to provide the exact date. e.g. “31 Dec 2020”</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 id="">Trial</h2>
        <p>By default, the Trial days is set to zero days.  i.e. No Trial. However a website can set a Trial to a higher value (Ex: 30 days) to attract more customers to try their product. </p>
        <p>Think about it. When a website advertise like “30 days Money back guarantee”, they may return your money, but they are still keeping your email address. That means the website can contact you any time in the future. They can also sell your email address to spammers. </p>
        <p>But If the website also advertise like “30 days Combox trial”, that means the website is giving you some sort of “No strings attached guarantee”. You can “Cancel” the contract within the trial period. </p>
        <p>When you cancel the contract, the box instantly goes “Offline”.</p>
        <p>For the sake of our example, let’s assume there is a Note Taking website called AwesomeNotes.com  </p>
        <p>The website owner of AwesomeNotes believes people are gonna love his product if they try his product for just 10 minutes. So the website owner sets the Trial Days to “30 Days” to attract more users.</p>
        <p>Priya sees this “No strings attached guarantee” and she understands that she can walk away anytime without receiving any annoying mails from the website owner. Since she got nothing to lose, she uses our “Teleport” button and voila, within a matter of seconds she is now a proud member of AwesomeNotes.</p>
        <p>Priya Signed Up on “01, Jan 2020” and the Trial ends on “30, Jan 2020”</p>
        <p>Priya clicks the “Cancel Contract” button on Jan 10. The box goes “Offline”. She can’t put the box “Online” unless she continue the contract. Note: If the box is “Offline”, all incoming mails will be rejected. So “Offline” boxes are “Read-Only” boxes.</p>
        <p>10 Days later Priya decided to continue the contract.  So she clicks the “Continue Contract” button on Jan 20. The “Cancel Contract” button still available till Jan 30. She can cancel the contract anytime before Jan 30. But if 30 days passed since her signup date, then the “Cancel Contract” button won’t be available. </p>
        <p>However, when the box is in “Cancelled” status, the “Continue Contract” will always be available even after the trial days. If Priya click the “Continue Contract” button on Feb 20 instead of Jan 20, then she can’t cancel the contract anymore.</p>
        <p>Note: Whether its a Flexible Contract or Fixed Contract, all contracts can have the Trial.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 id="">Maximum Possible Contract Length </h2>
        <p>Answer these questions… </p>
        <p>What’s preventing a website owner from setting the relative duration value to “2000 years” instead of “2 years”?   </p>
        <p>What’s preventing the music concert organiser from setting the absolute date to the year “Dec 3020” instead of “Dec 2020”. </p>
        <p>We cannot ask our users to stay on contract for 1000 years. Can we? That would be crazy right?</p>
        <p>So whether its a Fixed contract or Flexible Contract, all Contracts must have a maximum duration. This is what we call “Maximum Possible Contract Length”</p>
        <p>The formula for “Maximum Possible Contract Length” calculation is </p>
        <p style="color: green; font-style: italic; text-align: center; font-size: 150%">L<sub>max</sub> = H<sub>max</sub> − A<sub>min</sub></p>
        <p>Where L<sub>max</sub> = Maximum Possible Contract Length (in Days)</p>
        <p>Where H<sub>max</sub> = Longest known human lifespan in History (in Days).</p>
        <p>Where A<sub>min</sub> = Minimum age required to signup for Dombox mail service (in Days).</p>
        <p>H<sub>max</sub> is the longest known human lifespan in History (in Days). This value is a constant. Jeanne Louise Calment from France holds the current Guinness record for “Oldest Person Ever”. She was born in 21 February 1875. Died in 04 August 1997. So her lifespan 44,724 days is used as value. </p>
        <p>This constant value 44724 cannot be changed until someone else break that Guinness record. The new record holder must be officially replaced the old record holder in Guinness world records to modify this constant. </p>
        <p>A<sub>min</sub> is the minimum age required to signup for our mail service. The value should be in Days. This value is a constant too. At this moment a person should be 13 years old to signup for our mail service. Although the minimum age requirement may vary based on user’s country, we are gonna stick with the US standard for this one.</p>
        <p>To calculate the Days, we use the first 13 years of Jeanne Louise Calment. So it would be treated like she joined our mail service when she turned 13 and used it till her death. The number of days from 21 February 1875 to 21 February 1888 is used to calculate this value. So the value is 4,748 days. i.e The first 13 years of her age. This value cannot changed until our mail service minimum age requirement for US get changed. </p>
        <p>Maximum Possible Contract Length in Days: 39976 Days </p>
        <p>Maximum Possible Contract Length in Years: ~ 109.5 Years</p>
        <p>Both “Absolute” contracts and “Relative” contracts must comply with “Maximum Possible Contract Length”. </p>
        <p>The relative end duration can be in Days, Weeks, Months and Years. </p>
        <p>If the relative end duration is in days, the maximum value is 39976 Days. </p>
        <p>If the relative end duration is in weeks, the maximum value is 5710 weeks. </p>
        <p>If the relative end duration is in months, the maximum value is 1314 months. </p>
        <p>If the relative end duration is in years, the maximum value is 109 years. </p>
        <p>The “Absolute end date” must be an exact date. When the website owner set this date while creating a Portal, the end date cannot be a date that is greater than 39976 days from the current date.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 id="">Initial Duration</h2>
        <p>There are websites out there that goes out of business within a year of their launch date.</p>
        <p>Now, What would happen to those people who had signed up in such websites if they were actually under a contract?  The website is gone, but the users are still locked in their contracts. Right?</p>
        <p>If we tell the users that they have to wait 109 years to delete the box, they are gonna be furious. On the other hand, If we let them delete their box, and if the website owner put his website back online, say 15 years later, then our company will be in trouble. Because users are gone but 109 years contract length has not over yet.</p>
        <p>To solve this problem, whether its a Flexible Contract or Fixed Contract, all contracts comes only with an Initial Duration and the website need to earn the remaining duration by renewing them (by sending a mail that passes all 5 layers).</p>
        <p>Two types of Initial Duration available.</p>
        <p>Initial Duration for "Good Standing" => 5 years</p>
        <p>Initial Duration for “Combox” => 5 years</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 id="">Renewal</h2>
        <p>All Contracts should be renewed by the website and not by the user. </p>
        <p>Two types of renewal required for all contracts. </p>
        <p>(A) Global Renewal </p>
        <p>(B) Local Renewal </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 id="">Global Renewal</h2>
        <p>The business must send at least one “5 layer passed mail” from the “Dombox Domain” every five years to any mail account in our mail system to keep the “Good Standing” status. This is called “Global Renewal”. </p>
        <p>All renewals comes with a 5 year extension. </p>
        <p>If a domain gets “Good Standing” status for the first time in Jan 1st, 2020, its valid till Jan 1st, 2025. To get 5 year extension (i.e Till Jan 1st, 2030), at least one 5 layer passed mail must be sent between Jan 1st, 2020 to Jan 1st, 2025.</p>
        <p>The point of “Global Renewal” is to make sure the website is an active one and not out of business.</p>
        <p>Note: The value “5 years” may get changed in the future.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 id="">Local Renewal</h2>
        <p>When a contract is signed by the consumer, the “Combox” comes with a 5 year duration. </p>
        <p>The business must send at least one “5 layer passed mail” every five years to the “Combox” to extend the contract by 5 more years. This is called “Local Renewal”.</p>
        <p>e.g. If a contract is signed by the consumer on Jan 1st, 2020 its valid till Jan 1st, 2025. If the business send at least one “5 layer passed mail” between Jan 1st, 2020 to Jan 1st, 2025 then the contract is renewed till Jan 1st, 2030. </p>
        <p>The point of “Local Renewal” is to make sure the user don’t have any stalled (inactive) boxes for a long time.</p>
        <p>Note: For Global Renewal “5 layer passed mail” must be from the “Dombox Domain” to be considered as valid. But for “Local Renewal” mail from “SAD Domains” are considered valid too.</p>
        <p>Also note, "Local Renewal" depends on "Global Renewal". i.e. If the business is not in “Good Standing” status, then the "Local Renewal" won't happen</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 id="">Duration vs Renewal</h2>
        <p>The “Duration” part and the “Renewal” part may cause some confusion</p>
        <p>Let us clarify them here</p>
        <p>The maximum possible contract length is 39976 Days</p>
        <p>When we use the term "Flexible Contract", we are actually referring to a contract that expires 39976 days from the signup date. i.e The full possible duration</p>
        <p>If you are website owner and you have no idea whether you should pick "Flexible Contract" or "Fixed Contract" for contract type, you should always pick the "Flexible Contract" type</p>
        <p>You should pick "Fixed contract" type only on special cases like Student course, Music concert etc. In a nutshell pick "Fixed Contracts" only for short term contracts. </p>
        <p>Again.. When in doubt, Always go with “Flexible Contract” type.</p>
        <p>Although “Flexible Contracts” has full possible duration, it only comes with initial duration. The website needs to keep on renewing them by sending mails. That's why its called Flexible contact</p>
        <p>In a way, Fixed Contracts also same as Flexible contracts. What makes them different is the end date.</p>
        <p>For the sake of our example, Let’s say both the Initial term and the Renewal term is 10 years. That means the flexible contract needs at least 10 renewals in the 109 years</p>
        <p>e.g. Contract Signed in the year 2000. The flexible contract is valid till the year 2109. But the initial term comes with only 10 years. If the website sends at least one mail in between 2000 to 2010, then its renewed till 2020. If the website sends at least one mail in between 2010 to 2020, then its renewed till 2030 and so on</p>
        <p>Same rules apply for “Fixed Contracts” but the renewal happens until the “end date” set by the website owner.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 id="">Deadlock</h2>
        <p>Once you create your first Portal, you are officially our “Portal Partner”.</p>
        <p>When a site becomes our “Portal Partner” that usually means they are displaying the “Teleport” button and that site requires a contract to create a Combox. In Such cases Consumers cannot add a Dombox via “Add Dombox” page.</p>
        <p>If they enter a “Portal Partner” domain in the “Add Dombox” page, they will get a message like this.  </p>
        <p>“buyfruits.in is our Portal Partner. Please use the Teleport button to signup”</p>
        <p>So “Dombox (D)” box type is disabled for the “Portal Partner” domains.</p>
        <p>If you remove the “Teleport” from your website, you are creating a deadlock since we already disabled the Dombox (D) box type. So make sure you are not breaching our “Partner” terms. Otherwise all your existing contract will be terminated.</p>
        <p>Terminating all your contracts will be the final straw. We will keep in touch with you via email if there is any issue. </p>
        <p>Note: Don’t get us wrong. You are welcome to remove our “Teleport” button as long as you don’t allow signup / Login via any other methods. e.g. Signup Forms, Facebook connect, Google connect etc. </p>
        <p>If you allow only “Login” via other methods, then we expect you to put the “Portal” in “Login Only” mode.  This way we don’t allow new contracts, but our existing users can use your website without any issues. </p>
        <p>We are gonna advertise our product as “Parallel Internet” to the domain owners. This is because our internet revolves around "Isolated Mailboxes" as opposed to traditional "Normal Mailboxes". So we are expecting the same thing what the other Internet Users get from you. </p>
        <p>So In simple words we are looking for “Equal Treatment”. In complex legal terms this is called Most Favoured Nation (MFN) Clause. Although the term “Most Favoured Nation (MFN)” may sound like giving special treatment to a particular nation, its actually about Non-Discrimination</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 id="">Termination</h2>
